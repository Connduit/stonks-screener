# TODO

### NOTES

    - right now there's no reason to have google sheets stuff if im making a json file to then upload to google sheets. maybe this will be more useful it im directly uploading to drive instead of making any json file.
    - RelativeVolume (TradingView) = volume/ta.sma(volume[1], 10)
        - meaning get the average of 10 volume not including the current day tho
        - chatgpt formula:
	        RV = (current volume of in-progress candle)/(average volume for time period)
		     * (time elapsed)/(time remaining)

### Where I Left Off

    - token problem...? failing to push changes 
    - stock data isn't being stored in google sheet

    

### Future Ideas
    
    - use go, svelte, js, ts, css, html, and wasm files when using live data from a paid api
    - maybe use azure web app?
