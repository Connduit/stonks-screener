# TODO

### NOTES

    - right now there's no reason to have google sheets stuff if im making a json file to then upload to google sheets. maybe this will be more useful it im directly uploading to drive instead of making any json file.

### Where I Left Off

    - token problem...? failing to push changes 
    - stock data isn't being stored in google sheet

    

### Future Ideas
    
    - use go, svelte, js, ts, css, html, and wasm files when using live data from a paid api
    - maybe use azure web app?
